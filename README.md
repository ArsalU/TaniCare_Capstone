## Overview
TaniCare is a plant disease classification project aimed at helping farmers identify diseases in crops using deep learning techniques. This project utilizes transfer learning with the MobileNetV2 model to classify various plant diseases based on images.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is the "Plant Disease Classification Merged Dataset" sourced from Kaggle. The dataset contains images of healthy and diseased crops, specifically focusing on corn, soybean, cassava, rice, wheat, and potato.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following libraries:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn opencv-python scikit-learn
